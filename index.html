	<p id='srcText'> Click the "Write File" button to write this paragraph's
		text to a file, with the name from the "File Name" input. If the
		write succeeds, or if the write fails and triggers an error callback
		then an Alert dialog will be shown. However, if no Alert is shown,
		then the write has failed with a lower-level error, shown only on the
		console log. Note that the file writing code is adapted as directly
		as possible from the sample code at:
		http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/
	</p>
	<p>Folder "AndFileTest" will be created (if it doesn't exist) in the 
		default persistent file location. It will be readable by other
		installed programs, so you can check the results of the writes of
		sample text files to this folder by this program.

	<p>This is a test of the Phonegap core file plugin, which seemed to fail
		on our Samsung Galaxy 7 test device, even though it works on other
		devices. I built version 1.0 with build.phonegap.com using their file
		plugin 1.0.1. It is available here, and crashes on the Samsung 7:
				Builder: https://build.phonegap.com/apps/894233/builds
		Now am re-doing it for cordova CLI, which is has a bugfixed file plugin 1.1.0
